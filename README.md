# Handwritten Digit Recognition 

This project uses a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The neural network is trained on a set of labeled images of handwritten digits and is then used to predict the digit shown in a new image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
“`
git clone https://github.com/serkankrdag/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
“`
2. Install the required packages:
“`
pip install -r requirements.txt
“`

## Usage

1. Run the training script:
“`
python train.py
“`
2. Run the prediction script and pass in the path to an image file:
“`
python predict.py path/to/image.png
“`

The prediction script will output the predicted digit.

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 98.3% on the test set, demonstrating the power of neural networks in image recognition tasks.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the potential of artificial intelligence to automate and improve many aspects of our daily lives, and demonstrates how neural networks can be used to recognize handwritten digits with a high degree of accuracy.
